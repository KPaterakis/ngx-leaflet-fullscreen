# NGX-Leaflet-Fullscreen

This is a wrapper for the [leaflet-fullscreen control] (https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.fullscreen) to make it easy to use in Angular 8+.

This wrapper is tested against the [@asymettrik/ngx-leaflet](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet) library but it has no dependency on that library so *should* work without it.

# Install

Install using npm:

```
npm install @runette/ngx-leaflet-fullscreen
```

# Usage

This library needs to be imported into the application module
